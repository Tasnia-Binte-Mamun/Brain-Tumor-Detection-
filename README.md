Performing Image Enhancement 

Edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt and Canny filter 

Filtering to remove noise

#### Segmentation is done in three following ways:

1. Segmentation using thresholding technique (Manual segmentation and obtaining tumor outline)

2. Segmentation using k means clustering

3. Segmentation using region growing algorithm
