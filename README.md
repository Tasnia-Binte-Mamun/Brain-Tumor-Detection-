For proper detection of tumor region, following operations are performed:

Loading MRI Image and Converting to Grayscale

#### Segmentation is done in three following ways:

1. Segmentation using thresholding technique (Manual segmentation and obtaining tumor outline)

2. Segmentation using k means clustering

3. Segmentation using region growing algorithm
