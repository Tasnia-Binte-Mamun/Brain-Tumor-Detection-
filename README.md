## Brain Tumor Detection Based on Segmentation using MATLAB

For proper detection of tumor region, following operations are performed:

Loading MRI Image and Converting to Grayscale

Performing Image Enhancement 

Edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt and Canny filter 

Filtering to remove noise

#### Segmentation is done in three following ways:

1. Segmentation using thresholding technique (Manual segmentation and obtaining tumor outline)

2. Segmentation using k means clustering

3. Segmentation using region growing algorithm

### GUI interface
